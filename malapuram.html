The wooden rest house built here by the British offers a panoramic view of the elephants and deers grazing in the forest near by . One has to get prior permission from the Forest Department to enter the forest zone. Heavy restrictions are imposed as a measure to save the existing forest land. An elephant taming center is also here. The place Nilambur including Nedumkayam is selected for developing as Kerala's second eco - tourism destination.

    <p > Kerala has had a long association with teak and has always played a central role in its cultivation and trade. The word teak itself is said to have come from the Malayalam word 'theku'. The Teak Museum in Nilambur celebrates this ancient relationship and takes one on a special journey through history, chronicling teak and its importance in our culture
        Teak is still the most sought after form of timber. The museum was made of the sub-centre of Kerala Forest Research Institute (KFRI) in 1995. Teak is extremely significant in the area. The world's first Teak (Tectonagrandis) plantation was raised in Nilambur way back in the 1840s and is among the premier teak plantations in the world. Visitors come here in large numbers and are greeted by the extensive root system of a 55-year-old teak tree in the portico.

    <div><img src="img2/conolly.jpg"  alt="" width="300" height="250" class="center" align="left"></div>
    <p> According to the history, the original Teak plantation of 1846 was done by Shri. Chathu Menon under the order and supervision of Mr. H.V Conolly who was the Collector of Malabar between 1841 and 1855. The initial Nilambur plantation was of 1500 acres, and considered as the stepping stone to the foundation of systematic forest management in India. Later in 1933 (20-01-1993) the area was preserved for the research purposes and named as "The Conolly's Plantations". During the world war II, 9.1 acres of teak were chopped off to meet the timber requirements of the allies. The remaining plot is of 5.7 acres and is being preserved and protected by the Kerala Forest Department as Conolly's Plot.

        The forest department of Kerala has taken good measures to protect the natural habitat of Conolly's plot. Here you can find rare species of trees, plants, insects, birds, etc. One of the major attractions in the plot is the oldest teak known as Kannimari, it also hosts the remainings of Chathu Menon in its teak gardens.
