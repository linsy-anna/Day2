        <p >Illikal Kallu is a major tourist attraction spot in #Kottayam district of #Kerala (India). Situated about 3400 feet above sea level, it is also one of the highest peak in the western ghats. Illikal Kallu is a rock situated above Illikal Mala. The thing that makes this rock unique is that half of the rock has fallen off, and only the other half remains. This supplements the beautiful #mountains which surrounds the rock.
            Illickal Kallu comprises three hills, each rising to 3400 ft. and above sea level. Each of the hills has a peculiar shape. One of them resembles a mushroom, which is why it is known as Kuda Kallu (umbrella shaped rock). It is said that the medicinal herb Neela Koduveli grows here. This blue flower is also believed to possess supernatural powers, which could increase wealth and ensure a rich harvest. The second hill, has a small hunch on the sides and is therefore referred to as Koonu Kallu (hunch back rock). Across this rock is a 1/2 ft. </p>
