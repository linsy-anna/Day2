        Old Parumala Church
        Parumala is a small stretch of land on the shores of the river Pampa. Malankara Metropolitan Joseph Mar Dionysius wanted to establish a seminary in this area. A plot of land with an area of 2 acres was donated by Arikupurathu Mathen Karnavar to the Malankara Metropolitan for this purpose.
        
        An ordinary building called ‘Azhippura’ was soon built on this plot of land for conducting classes for the deacons etc. Syriac classes were begun here under the care of Fr.Yakob. In course of time, Metropolitan Mar Dionysius gave the charge of the seminary to Metropolitan Mar Gregorios (Later known as Parumala Thirumeni), in order to carry on the Syriac teaching sessions more efficiently and also to help him in other church matters.
        
        Temporary church in Parumala was rebuilt by Mar Gregorios and consecrated in 1895.

    <p >  Malayalapuzha Devi Temple is one of the famous temples dedicated to Goddess Durga in Kerala. This temple, which is located in the Pathanamthitta District of Kerala is regarded as one among the 108 Durga
        Temples called 108 Durgalayas. As in the case of many other Durga or Kali temples in Kerala, the legend of this temple too has its lineage with the famous Kollur Mookambika Temple of South Karnataka.
        There was a Brahmin (Namboodiri) devotee of Goddess Ma. He devoted his life to the Goddess and was always seen chanting her praises and holy hymns. Once he went to Mookambika Temple and started worshiping Goddess Ma. He used to live in the temple premises and used to have very little food that is offered from the temple. All he had with him was one Salagramam (A particular kind of stone seen in River Gandaki in Nepal. According to Hindu belief, this stone represents the divine power of Lord Vishnu and hence it is being worshiped) and an umbrella made of palm leaves.
        He spent years there worshipping Goddess and one night he had a dream where the Goddess Ma came in the dreams and told him that she had her presence in the Salagramam worshiped by the Namboodiri and now he can return to his village .   </p>
